# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

This project involves a startup called ***Sparkify*** they nedeed to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app, with the main objective being to understand what songs users are listening to. They wanted to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My task was to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
